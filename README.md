# Discord Rich Presence

Create an interactive rich presence application on Discord to show extra information and buttons on your profile.

Developed by [AngaBlue](https://anga.blue)

## Setup

1.  Create a new application on the [Discord Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers).
2.  Fill out the application details and upload an image under Rich Presence with the key `logo-1080`.
3.  Create a `.env` file with the keys `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.  Fill both of these values out accordingly.
4.  Modify any string values that you like in `index.mjs` (fork if you'd like to save your changes through git)
5.  Create a shortcut to `discord-rpc.vbs` in your startup folder in order to start the rich presence application when you reboot your computer.  To access your startup folder, press `Win`+`r` and type `shell:startup`.
6.  At any point, you can manually start the rich presence application by double clicking `discord-rpc.vbs`.
